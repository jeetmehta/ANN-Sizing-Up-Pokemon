# ANNs - Using Neural Networks to Segment Pokemon

This project makes use of a standard, 10-neuron single-layer feedforward neural net in MATLAB in order to segment input Pokemon images by "size". Size is defined by pixel-density in this case, which essentially is a ratio of the coloured/object-specific pixels to the entire image.
